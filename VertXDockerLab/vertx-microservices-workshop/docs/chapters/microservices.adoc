## Demystifying microservices

Except (and actually, I'm not sure) if you spent the last year in a cave, you probably heard about _microservices_.
What what are _microservices_ ? Let's use the following definition:

[quote, Martin Fowler, http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html]
The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These
services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming
languages and use different data storage technologies.

_Microservice_ is an _architectural style_, so a _specialization of element and relation types, together with
constraints and how they can be used_ footnote:[This is the definition of _architecture styles_ from the Software
Engineering Institute.]. And now, you say "what ???".

Let's rewind, and take another approach... Why did we end up with _microservices_. In one word: **agility**
footnote:[Ability to move quickly and easily, not related to the Agile methodologies]. Let's imagine, you have
an  application, rather large, and as with all large applications, the maintenance is a nightmare, adding features take
 too much time, the technology used is very outdated (What ? Corba is not cool anymore ?), any change needs to pass a
 50-steps process and be validated by 5 levels of management, obviously there are several teams on the application with
  different requirements and agendas. Well, you have such a _monster app_. How could we make the development and
  maintenance of this application efficient ? Microservices are one answer to this question. It aims to reduce the
  _time to production_.

To do that, the _microservice_ architectural style proposes to:

1. split the application into a set of decoupled components providing defined `services` (_defined_ means with a
known interface or API)
2. the components communicate with whatever protocol, often REST, but not necessary
3. the components use whatever languages and technologies they want
4. each component is developed, released and deployed independently
5. the deployments intend to be _automated_ in their own _pipeline_
6. the orchestration of the whole application needs to be reduced to the bare minimum

In this lab, we don't address the point 5, but you should know that Vert.x does not restricts how you want to deploy
your components (ssh, ansible, puppet, docker, cloud, floppy disk).

The last point is interesting, and often misunderstood. It's pretty cool to develop independent pieces of software
that magically interact at runtime.... But actually, there is no magic (sorry). There is some service _discovery_
happening.

Before using a `service` provided by another component, it should find it. The location can be hardcoded
in the code (but it's generally not a good idea), use a name resolved using a DNS lookup, or use more advanced
frameworks.  Having a  service discovery mechanism also provides a consolidated view of what's there. Being able to
discover the different services, or resources available lets you implement some _transparency_, an inherent
characteristic of distributed systems. For instance, it lets your components react smoothly to location changes. It
enables load-balancing (such as with a round robin), fault-tolerance (by looking for another service provider) and so on.

Even if not necessary per definition, microservice applications are generally distributed. This comes with all the
distributed application benefits and constraints: consensus computation, CAP theorem, consistency, monitoring, and many
many reasons to **fail**. So microservices applications need to be design to face failures from their early stage.

Even if in the previous pseudo-definition of microservices, it's about splitting an existing application into a set
of independent components, there are also greenfield applications that can choose the microservice approach, following
the same principles: a set of independent components interacting at runtime to deliver the _high-level_ service.

There are a couple of points I would like to mention before going further. _Microservices_ are **not** new and is not
 rocket science... Academic papers from the 70's and 80's have defined (using different words) architectural styles very
  close to this. Another very important point to understand right away: microservices are not a silver bullet, it is
  going to increase the complexity of the whole system (because you become more distributed).

It's really about rapid delivery and adaptation. It's also about independence and replaceability. Every microservice is
made to be replaceable by another one providing the same _service / API / interface_ (it's an application of the
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle[Liskov substitution principle]).

If you are a developer since a couple of years, you may wonder the difference between microservices and SOA. It's not
a question of size, and actually the word "microservice" is not really appropriate, as size does not matter.
Microservices and SOA have different purposes. SOA is about integrating systems handled by different stakeholders,
while microservices is about reducing the time to production. That said, behind the hood, the concepts are close:

* service : a defined feature accessible by an API, a client, a proxy...
* service provider: a component implementing a service
* service consumer: a component consuming a service
* service discovery: the mechanism used by a consumer to find a provider

Both approaches inherit from the _service oriented computing_, aiming to decompose and manage independent piece of
software. You may have never heard about this even if you used it: COM, Corba, Jini, OSGi, and web services are
different implementations of _service oriented computing_.

Are microservices limited to REST ? No, and actually it's a common misconception. Microservices can use whatever
interaction style that fit their service: RPC, events, messages, streams.... In this lab we are going to see REST
services, async RPC, and message sources.
