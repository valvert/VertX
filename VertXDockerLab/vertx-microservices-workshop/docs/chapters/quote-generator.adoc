## The first microservice - the quote generator

Disclaimer, the quote generator is unrealistic, and is basically a set of randoms...

### Project structure

Let's have a look to the project, as every other project are structured the same way.

[source]

├── README.md <--- component description
├── pom.xml <--- the Maven file
└── src
    ├── docker
    │   └── config.json <--- a configuration file that is passed when the component starts in its docker container
    └── main
        └── java
            └── io.vertx.workshop.quote

                            ├── QuoteVerticle.java
                            └── RestQuoteAPIVerticle.java
----

Let's start with the `pom.xml` file. This file specifies the Maven build:

1. Define the dependencies
2. Build a _fat-jar_
3. Build a docker container

A _fat-jar_ is a convenient way to package a Vert.x application. It creates a _über-jar_ containing your application
and all its dependencies, including Vert.x. Then, to launch it, you just need to use `java -jar ....`, without having
to handle the `CLASSPATH`. Wait, I told you that Vert.x does not dictate a type of packaging. It's true, fat jars
are convenient, but it's the the only way.

The created _fat-jar_ is configured to use the `io.vertx.core.Launcher` main class, but you can use your own _main_
class. The `Launcher` class creates the Vert.x instance, configure it and deploys the _main-verticle_. Again, it's
just a convenient way, you can use your own _main_ class.

The `pom.xml` file is also configured to create a Docker container, configured to launch the application.

### Verticle

As you may have noticed, the code is structured in 3 `verticles`, but what are these? Verticles is a way to structure
 Vert.x application code. It's not mandatory, but it is quite convenient. A verticle is a chunk of code that is
 deployed on top of a Vert.x instance. A verticle has access to the instance of `vertx` on which it's deployed, and
 can deploy other verticles.

Let's open the `GeneratorConfigVerticle` class, and look at the `start` method:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public void start() {
    super.start();

    JsonArray quotes = config().getJsonArray("companies");
    for (Object q : quotes) {
      JsonObject company = (JsonObject) q;
      // Deploy the verticle with a configuration.
      vertx.deployVerticle(MarketDataVerticle.class.getName(),
         new DeploymentOptions().setConfig(company));
    }

    vertx.deployVerticle(RestQuoteAPIVerticle.class.getName());

    publishMessageSource("market-data", ADDRESS, rec -> {
      if (!rec.succeeded()) {
        rec.cause().printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println("Market-Data service published : " + rec.succeeded());
    });
}
----

Verticles can retrieve a configuration using the `config()` method. Here it gets the details about the company to
simulate. The configuration is a `JsonObject`. Vert.x heavily uses JSON, so you are going to see a lot of JSON during the lab. For each company found in the configuration, it deploys another verticle with the extracted configuration. Finally, it deploys another verticle providing a very simple HTTP API.

The last part of the method is about the service discovery mentioned in the microservice section. This component
generates quotes sent on the event bus. But to let other components discover where the messages are sent (_where_
means on which address), it registers it. `market-data` is the name of the service, `ADDRESS` is the event bus
address on which the messages are sent. The last argument is a `Handler` that is notified when the registration has
been completed. The `handler` receives a structured called `AsyncResult`.

Remember, Vert.x is promoting an asynchronous, non-blocking development model. Publishing the service may take time
(actually it does as it creates a record, write it to the backend, and notifies everyone), as we cannot block the
 event loop, the method is asynchronous. Asynchronous methods have a `Handler` as last parameter that is invoked when
 the operation has been completed. This `Handler` is called with the same event loop as the one having called the async
 method. As the asynchronous operation can fail, the `Handler` receives as parameter an `AsyncResult` telling
 whether or not the operation has succeeded. You will see the following patterns a lot in Vert.x applications:

[source, java]
----
 // Asynchronous method returning an object of type X
 operation(param1, param2, Handler<AsyncResult<X>>);

 // Handler receiving an object of type X

 ar -> {
   if (ar.succeeded()) {
      X x = ar.result();
      // Do something with X
   } else {
      // it failed
      Throwable cause = ar.cause();
   }
 }
----

If you remember the architecture, the quote generator also provides a HTTP endpoint returning the last values of the
quotes (but, you are going to work on it). This _service_ is not published, as we are going to "publish" it using
Docker (no code required, Docker publishes it).

### The consolidation endpoint

It's time for you to develop some parts of the application (I know you have pins and needles in your fingers). Open the
`RestQuoteAPIVerticle`. It's a verticle class extending `AbstractVerticle`. In the `start` method you need to:

1. Register an event bus consumer to collect the last quotations (in the `quotes` map)
2. Handle HTTP requests to return the list of quotes, or a single quote if the `name` (query) param is set.

Let's do that....

#### Implementing a Handler to receive events

The first action is about creating a `Handler`, so a method that is invoked on event. Here, the `Handler` is going to
be called for every messages sent on the event bus on a specific `address` (receiving each quote sent by the generator).
 In the `Handler` body, write:

[source, java,role=assignment]
----
JsonObject quote = message.body(); // 1
quotes.put(quote.getString("name"), quote); // 2
----

First, it retrieves the message body (1). It's a JSON object, and stores it in the `quotes` map (2).

#### Implementing a Handler to handle HTTP requests

Let's now implement the second point.  To handle the HTTP requests, we need a HTTP server. Fortunately, Vert.x lets
you create HTTP servers using:

[source, java]
----
vertx.createHttpServer()
    .requestHandler(request -> {...})
    .listen(port, resultHandler);
----


Replace the content of the `requestHandler` (a handler called on every incoming HTTP request) by:

[source, java, role=assignment]
----
HttpServerResponse response = request.response()    // <1>
    .putHeader("content-type", "application/json");
String company = request.getParam("name");          // <2>
if (company == null) {
    String content = Json.encodePrettily(quotes);   // <3>
    response
        .end(content);                              // <4>
 } else {
    JsonObject quote = quotes.get(company);
    if (quote == null) {
      response.setStatusCode(404).end();            // <5>
    } else {
      response.end(quote.encodePrettily());
    }
 }
----
<1> Get the `response` object from the `request`
<2> Gets the `name` parameter (query parameter)
<3> Encode the map to JSON
<4> Write the response and flush it using `end(...)`
<5> If the given name does not match a company, set the status code to `404`

You may wonder why synchronization is not required. Indeed we write in the map and read from it without any
synchronization constructs. Here is one of the main feature of Vert.x: all this code is going to be executed by
the **same** event loop, so it's always accessed by the **same** thread, never concurrently.

TIP: The `Map<String, JsonObject>` could be replaced by a simple `JsonObject` as they behave as a `Map<String, Object>`.

### Time to start the quote generator

First, let's build the docker image. In the terminal, execute:

----
cd quote-generator
mvn package docker:build
----

Then, open a new terminal and launch:

----
docker run -p 8081:8080 --rm --name quote-generator vertx-microservice-workshop/quote-generator
----

Let's analyze this docker command. It runs a container created from the image we just built
(`vertx-microservice-workshop/quote-generator`). We give it a name (`quote-generator`). The `-p` option configure the
port forwarding. The port `8080` of the application is now exposed on the port `8081` of your machine (or the
docker-machine). In our microservice world, it also means that the HTTP endpoint becomes discoverable.

Let's now open a browser and have a look to http://dockerhost:8081.

It should return something like:

----
{
  "MacroHard" : {
    "volume" : 100000,
    "shares" : 51351,
    "symbol" : "MCH",
    "name" : "MacroHard",
    "ask" : 655.0,
    "bid" : 666.0,
    "open" : 600.0
  },
  "Black Coat" : {
    "volume" : 90000,
    "shares" : 45889,
    "symbol" : "BCT",
    "name" : "Black Coat",
    "ask" : 654.0,
    "bid" : 641.0,
    "open" : 300.0
  },
  "Divinator" : {
    "volume" : 500000,
    "shares" : 251415,
    "symbol" : "DVN",
    "name" : "Divinator",
    "ask" : 877.0,
    "bid" : 868.0,
    "open" : 800.0
  }
}
----

It gives the current details of each quotes. The data is updated every 3 seconds, so refresh your browser to get
the latest data.

Let's now launch the dashboard. In another terminal, navigate to `$project-home/trader-dashboard` and execute:

[source]
----
mvn clean package docker:build
docker run -p 8083:8080 --rm --name dashboard vertx-microservice-workshop/trader-dashboard
----

TIP: If Docker is yelling with something like `Error response from daemon: Conflict. The name "/xyz" is
already in use by container...`, no problem, let be more convincing and launch `docker rm -f xyz` and
then relaunch the command.

Then, open your browser to http://dockerhost:8083. You should see:

image::dashboard-initial-state.png[Dashboard, 800]

Some parts have no _content_, and it's normal as it's just the beginning...

### You are not a financial expert ?

So maybe you are not used to the financial world and words... I'm not too, and this is a overly simplified version.
Let's define the important fields:

* `name` : the company name
* `symbol` : short name
* `shares` : the number of stock that can be bought
* `open` : the stock price when the session opened
* `ask` : the price of the stock when you buy them (seller price)
* `bid` : the price of the stock when you sell them (buyer price)
