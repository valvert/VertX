## Anatomy of the dashboard

This section is about the dashboard. You won't have to write any code. It just explains how it works:

1. How to configure configure Vert.x web to expose static resources
2. How to configure the SockJS - Eventbus bridge
3. How to implement a REST endpoint delegating to another REST endpoint (proxy pattern)
4. How can you consume an event bus proxy from the browser

The dashboard is a single verticle (`io.vertx.workshop.dashboard.DashboardVerticle`).

### Vert.x Web and static files

As mentioned in the previous section, Vert.x web is a Vert.x component to build web application. Its whole
architecture is centered on the `Router` object. You create this router and configure the _routes_. For each route
you configure the _HTTP verb_ and the _path_ and associate the `Handler` that is called when a matching request is
received. The `router` is creates a follows:

[source, java]
----
Router router = Router.router(vertx);
----

Vert.x web provides a set of `Handler` for common tasks such as serving static files:

[source, java]
----
// Static content
router.route("/*").handler(StaticHandler.create());
----

It serves all files from the `webroot` directory (default) or the server root. For example, `webroot/index.html` is
served using the `http://0.0.0.0:8080/index.html` url.

Once the router is configured, you need a HTTP server and use the router to handle the requests:

[source, java]
----
vertx.createHttpServer()
    .requestHandler(router::accept)
    .listen(8080);
----

### SockJS - Event bus bridge

SockJS is a browser JavaScript library that provides a WebSocket-like object. SockJS gives you a coherent, cross-browser,
Javascript API which creates a low latency, full duplex, cross-domain communication channel between the browser and the
web server. Under the hood SockJS tries to use native WebSockets first. If that fails it can use a variety of
browser-specific transport protocols and presents them through WebSocket-like abstractions. SockJS-client does require
a server counterpart to handle the communication. And you know what, Vert.x implements it !

With the SockJS - Event bus bridge, events from the event bus can be sent to browsers and JavaScript code running in
the browser can send messages to the event bus.

To enable the bridge you need thw following code:

[source, java]
----
SockJSHandler sockJSHandler = SockJSHandler.create(vertx);                      // <1>
BridgeOptions options = new BridgeOptions();
options
    .addOutboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("market"))         // <2>
    .addOutboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("portfolio"))
    .addOutboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("service.portfolio"))
    .addInboundPermitted(new PermittedOptions().setAddress("service.portfolio"));

sockJSHandler.bridge(options);                                                 // <3>
router.route("/eventbus/*").handler(sockJSHandler);                            // <4>
----

In (1), we create the `SockJSHandler`. It needs to be configured, as by default, for security reasons, no messages are
 transmitted. A set of permitted addresses configures bridge (2). Outbound addresses are for messages from the event
 bus to the browser, while inbound addresses are for messages from the browser to the event bus. Finally in (3) and
 (4), it configures the handler and create a router in the `router`. The `/eventbus/*` path is used by the SockJS
 client (in the browser) to negotiate the connection, receive and send the messages.

This is not the only bridge that exists for the event bus. There is also a TCP event bus bridge for native systems.
Notice also, that the SockJS bridge can also be used from Node.JS.

### Delegating REST calls

It's often required to implement a REST API on top of another one. This pattern can be very costly on traditional
architecture as each call would block a thread until the call to this second REST API has completed. With Vert.x
delegation is easy, asynchronous and non blocking.

For example in the dashboard, we want to retrieve the list of operations. This list is offered by the audit service.
So in the dashboard we have this route definition:

[source, java]
----
router.get("/operations").handler(this::lastOperations);
----

And the handler is:

[source, java]
----
private void lastOperations(RoutingContext context) {
    HttpEndpoint.getClient(discovery, new JsonObject().put("name", "AUDIT"), client -> {
        if (client.failed() || client.result() == null) {
            context.response()
                .putHeader("content-type", "application/json")
                .setStatusCode(200)
                .end(new JsonObject().put("message", "No audit service").encode());
        } else {
            client.result().get("/", response -> {
              response
                  .exceptionHandler(context::fail)
                  .bodyHandler(buffer -> {
                    context.response()
                        .putHeader("content-type", "application/json")
                        .setStatusCode(200)
                        .end(buffer);
                    client.result().close();
                  });
            })
                .exceptionHandler(context::fail)
                .end();
        }
    });
}
----

It retrieves the audit service from the service discovery infrastructure and once it gets the HTTP client. It uses it
 to call the audit REST API. The response is simply sent back to the HTTP response. Finally, don't forget to close
 the HTTP client.

### Consuming event bus service from the browser

As said above, there is a bridge between sockJS and the event bus to let the browser sends and receives messages. As
event bus services communicate using event bus messages, it is possible to implement a service client in the browser.
 Vert.x generates this client for you.

So, if you open the `index.html` file, you can see:

[source, html]
----
<script src="libs/portfolio_service-proxy.js"></script>
----

This imports a script generated by Vert.x (in the portfolio project). Then we can use the service as follows:

[source, javascript]
----
var service = new PortfolioService(eventbus, "service.portfolio");
service.getPortfolio(function (err, res) {
   // ....
}
----

Yes, you can call the service method directly from your browser.
