## The compulsive traders

In the `portfolio` project we have implemented an event bus service to manage our portfolio. In the quote-generator
we send quotes on the event bus. Traders are components that consumes these two services with only one goal: getting
rich (or not...)!

In this section, we are going to develop 2 traders (following a stupid logic you can definitely be improved):

* the first trader is developed in Java
* the second trader is developed in Groovy

### Compulsive and dumb traders

Before seen how there are implemented, let's explain the absolutely illogic algorithm used by these traders:

1. A compulsive trader is picking randomly one company name and a number of shares (`x`)
2. Randomly, it tries to buy or sell `x` shares of the company

It does not check whether or not it has enough shares or money, it just tries... This logic is implemented in
`io.vertx.workshop.trader.impl.TraderUtils`.

### Deploying several instance and polyglot verticles.

The `compulsive-trader` project contains a _main-verticle_ (`io.vertx.workshop.trader.impl.MainVerticle`) that is
going to configure and deploy the traders:

[source]
----
@Override
public void start() throws Exception {

    // Java traders
    vertx.deployVerticle(JavaCompulsiveTraderVerticle.class.getName(),
        new DeploymentOptions().setInstances(2));                           // <1>

    // Groovy traders...
    vertx.deployVerticle("GroovyCompulsiveTraderVerticle.groovy");          // <2>
}
----

The `JavaCompulsiveTraderVerticle` is deployed with some `DeploymentOptions` (1). This one sets the _number of
instances_ to 2, so Vert.x is not instantiating this verticle once, with twice (2 different objects).
So, the previous code deploys three traders.

The Groovy verticle is deployed by passing the file name. The verticle file is in `src/main/resources` and will be
located at the root of the fat-jar.

It's now time to implement these verticles

### The Java Trader

Open the `io.vertx.workshop.trader.impl.JavaCompulsiveTraderVerticle` class. In the place of the `TODO` we need:

1. Initialize the trader
2. Retrieve the 2 services we use
3. When both have been retrieve, apply the trading logic on every new market data.

#### 1. Initialize the trader

First, look at the `start` method signature: `start(Future<Void> future)`. The `future` let us tell when the initialization has been completed and whether or not it has been successful. That means we have to `complete` or `fail` this `future` explicitly.

To initialize the trader, remove the `future.fail` statement and write:

[source, java, role=assignment]
----
String company = TraderUtils.pickACompany();
int numberOfShares = TraderUtils.pickANumber();
System.out.println("Java compulsive trader configured for company " + company + " and shares: " + numberOfShares);
----

#### 2. Retrieve the 2 services

The trader needs the `Portfolio` service and the `market` service (the message source sending the market data). We
cannot start the trading logic before having retrieved both of them. Let's use the `Future` composition feature we
have seen in the previous section.

[source, java, role=assignment]
----
// We need to retrieve two services, create two futures object that
// will get the services
Future<MessageConsumer<JsonObject>> marketFuture = Future.future();             // <1>
Future<PortfolioService> portfolioFuture = Future.future();

// Retrieve the services, use the "special" completed to assign the future
MessageSource.getConsumer(discovery, new JsonObject().put("name", "market-data"),
    marketFuture.completer());                                                  // <2>
EventBusService.getProxy(discovery, PortfolioService.class,
    portfolioFuture.completer());                                               // <3>

// When done (both services retrieved), execute the handler
CompositeFuture.all(marketFuture, portfolioFuture).setHandler(ar -> {           // <4>
   // Next....
});
----

First create the 2 `Future` objects that will receive the two services once retrieved (1). In (2) we retrieve the
message source service and use a special `Handler` to assign the `Future`. The `completer` is basically a `Handler`
receiving the result and setting the value in the `Future` or mark it as failed. The same approach is used in (3) to
retrieve the `Portfolio` service.

Finally, in <4>, we create a `CompositeFuture` that execute the attached `Handler` when all the listed `Futures` has
been assigned.

#### 3. Applying the trading logic

Almost done! Where we had the `Next...`, write:

[source, java, role=assignment]
----
if (ar.failed()) {                                                               // <1>
    future.fail("One of the required service cannot " +
            "be retrieved: " + ar.cause());
} else {
    // Our services:                                                             // <2>
    PortfolioService portfolio = portfolioFuture.result();
    MessageConsumer<JsonObject> marketConsumer = marketFuture.result();

    // Listen the market...
    marketConsumer.handler(message -> {                                          // <3>
        JsonObject quote = message.body();
        TraderUtils.dumbTradingLogic(company, numberOfShares, portfolio, quote); // <4>
    });

    future.complete();                                                           // <5>
}
----

First, we need to check if the service retrieval has been successful. This is made in (1). If so, we can unwrap the
services from the `Future` objects (2). We set a `Handler` on the `marketConsumer` (the message source service)
executing the trading logic (4). Finally, in (5), we complete the `future` given as parameter of the `start` method to notify of the completion of the initialization process. The `complete` method does not pass a _result_ as we just notify of the completion. Notice also the `future.fail` to denote an initialization issue.

#### The code in one snippet

Here is the whole code:

[source, java, role=assignment]
----
    super.start();

    String company = TraderUtils.pickACompany();
    int numberOfShares = TraderUtils.pickANumber();
    System.out.println("Java compulsive trader configured for company " + company + " and shares: " + numberOfShares);

    // We need to retrieve two services, create two futures object that will get the services
    Future<MessageConsumer<JsonObject>> marketFuture = Future.future();
    Future<PortfolioService> portfolioFuture = Future.future();
    // Retrieve the services, use the "special" completed to assign the future
    MessageSource.getConsumer(discovery, new JsonObject().put("name", "market-data"), marketFuture.completer());
    EventBusService.getProxy(discovery, PortfolioService.class, portfolioFuture.completer());

    // When done (both services retrieved), execute the handler
    CompositeFuture.all(marketFuture, portfolioFuture).setHandler(ar -> {
      if (ar.failed()) {
        future.fail("One of the required service cannot " +
            "be retrieved: " + ar.cause());
      } else {
        // Our services:
        PortfolioService portfolio = portfolioFuture.result();
        MessageConsumer<JsonObject> marketConsumer = marketFuture.result();

        // Listen the market...
        marketConsumer.handler(message -> {
          JsonObject quote = message.body();
          TraderUtils.dumbTradingLogic(company, numberOfShares, portfolio, quote);
        });

        future.complete();
      }
    });
----

#### Run this trader

We can already run this trader and see if it makes educated actions on the market. Package it using:

[source]
----
cd compulsive-traders
mvn clean package docker:build
----

Then launch the docker container with:

[source]
----
docker run --rm --name traders vertx-microservice-workshop/compulsive-traders
----

If you go back to the dashboard, you may start seen some moves on your portfolio.

### The Groovy Trader

The Groovy trader is using the same trading logic, but this verticle is going to be developed in Groovy. To ease the
understanding, the code is going to be very close to the Java version.

Open `src/main/resources/GroovyCompulsiveTraderVerticle.groovy`. This verticle is going to be a _Groovy Script_. So
the content is the `start` method of the verticle. Vert.x also supports Groovy classes.

Copy the following code in the file:

[source, groovy, role=assignment]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.CompositeFuture
import io.vertx.groovy.core.Future
import io.vertx.groovy.core.eventbus.MessageConsumer
import io.vertx.groovy.servicediscovery.types.EventBusService;
import io.vertx.groovy.servicediscovery.types.MessageSource;
import io.vertx.groovy.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery
import io.vertx.workshop.portfolio.PortfolioService
import io.vertx.workshop.trader.impl.TraderUtils

def company = TraderUtils.pickACompany();
def numberOfShares = TraderUtils.pickANumber();

println("Groovy compulsive trader configured for company " + company + " and shares: " + numberOfShares);

// We create the discovery service object.
def discovery = ServiceDiscovery.create(vertx);

Future<MessageConsumer<Map>> marketFuture = Future.future();
Future<PortfolioService> portfolioFuture = Future.future();

MessageSource.getConsumer(discovery,
        ["name" : "market-data"], marketFuture.completer());
EventBusService.getProxy(discovery,
        "io.vertx.workshop.portfolio.PortfolioService", portfolioFuture.completer());

// When done (both services retrieved), execute the handler
CompositeFuture.all(marketFuture, portfolioFuture).setHandler( { ar ->
  if (ar.failed()) {
    System.err.println("One of the required service cannot be retrieved: " + ar.cause());
  } else {
    // Our services:
    PortfolioService portfolio = portfolioFuture.result();
    MessageConsumer<Map> marketConsumer = marketFuture.result();

    // Listen the market...
    marketConsumer.handler( { message ->
      Map quote = message.body();
      TraderUtils.dumbTradingLogic(company, numberOfShares, portfolio, quote);
    });
  }
});
----

As you can see the code if very close to the Java one. Let's spot the differences:

* Well, it's in Groovy
* On the `import` statements, you can see it does import `groovy` version of the packages.
* We have to create the service discovery (as before it was made by a parent class)
* `JsonObjects` are `Maps`. In Groovy, it makes more sense to use `Map` objects.

When an interface is annotated with `@VertxGen`, Vert.x translates it to all the supported (and configured) languages
. Each translation tries to be as close as possible to the language idioms, that's why you have `Maps` in Groovy
instead of `JsonObject`.

This example has been developed in Groovy, but it would be similar in JavaScript, Ruby or Ceylon.

It's time to rebuild and restart our traders. Hit `CTRL+C` to stop the running trader (or launch `docker stop
traders`). Then, rebuild with:

[source]
----
mvn clean package docker:build
----

And launch the docker container with:

[source]
----
docker run --rm --name traders vertx-microservice-workshop/compulsive-traders
----

If you go back to the dashboard, you may start seen some moves on your portfolio. Now 3 traders are trying to make
you (virtually) rich.
