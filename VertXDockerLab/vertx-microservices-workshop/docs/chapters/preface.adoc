## Preface

Let's start from the beginning.... _Vert.x_. What's Vert.x ? That's a pretty good question, and probably a good start.
 If you go on the http://vertx.io[Vert.x web site], Vert.x is defined as _"a toolkit for building reactive
 applications on the JVM"_. This description is rather fuzzy no ? What's a toolkit ? What are reactive applications ?
 In this lab, we are going to explain these words, and build an application using Vert.x illustrating what Vert.x is.
 This application is going to be composed by _microservices_. Another buzzword to be trendy ? No, Vert.x was promoting
  _microservices_  before everyone and his dog jumped on the bandwagon.

The developed application is going to be:

* based on Vert.x (that's why you are here, no ?)
* distributed
* reactive
* (a bit) fun

This lab offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Vert.x, from the first line of code, to making
services, to consuming them and finally to assembling everything in a consistent reactive system. It illustrates what
are reactive systems, what is reactive programming, and how to build applications based on reactive microservice**s**
(the **s** is important).

This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop. You would also need Docker,
 not because Vert.x needs Docker (it does not!), but to simulate a distributed system.

What you are going to learn:

* What is Vert.x and how to use its asynchronous non-blocking development model
* How to develop microservices with Vert.x with several types of services, and service discovery
* What are and how to use `verticles`
* How to use the Vert.x event bus to send and receive messages
* How to expose HTTP endpoints with Vert.x, and also how to consume them
* How to compose asynchronous actions
* How to use several languages in the same application
* How to use databases

And many other points too...
