## The Micro-Trader Application

Now that you know more about Vert.x and microservices, it's time to discuss the application we are going to develop
in this lab.

It's going to be a fake financial app, where you need to make (virtual) money... The application is composed by a set of
microservices:

* The quote generator - this simulator, absolutely not realistic - generates the quotes for 3 companies _MacroHard_,
_Divinator_, and _Black Coat_. The market data are sent on the Vert.x event bus.

* The traders - the trader are a set of components receiving the quotes and deciding whether or not they want to
sell or buy shares. For this they rely on the _portfolio_ service.

* The portfolio - it manages the money and your current set of shares. It is exposed as a _service proxy_, i.e. a
asynchronous RPC service on top of the Vert.x event bus. For every successful operation, it sends a message on the event
 bus describing the operation. It uses the quote generator to evaluate the current value of the portfolio.

* The audit - that's the legal side... You need to keep a list of all your operations (yes, that's the law). The
audit component receives the operation from the event bus and stores them in a database. It also provides a REST
endpoint to retrieve the last operations.

* The dashboard - some UI to let you know if you became rich...

Let's have a look to the architecture:

The application uses several types of services:

* HTTP endpoint (_i.e._ REST API) - the service is located using a URL.
* Service proxies that are asynchronous services exposed on the event bus using a RPC interaction, the service is
located using a address.
* Message sources that are components publishing messages on the event bus, the service is located using a address.

At runtime, each component runs in its own docker container. The containers are going to be inter-connected with
links when name resolution is required.

The dashboard presents the available services, the value of each company quotes, the last operations made by your
traders and the current state of your portfolio:

You are going to implement critical parts of this application. The rest of the code is provided to illustrate some
other Vert.x features. The code that needs to be written by you is indicated using **TODO** and wrapped as follows:
