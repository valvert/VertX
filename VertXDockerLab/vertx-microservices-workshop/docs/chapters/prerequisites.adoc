## Prerequisites

It's going to be your turn now... But before starting, you need to install a couple of software on your machine.

### Hardware

* Operating System: Mac OS X (10.8+), Windows 7+, Ubuntu 12+, CentOS 7+, Fedora 22+
* Memory: At least 4 GB+, preferred 8 GB

### Docker

#### Docker Toolbox or Packages

Docker runs natively on Linux. Because the Docker daemon uses Linux-specific kernel features, you canâ€™t run Docker
natively in OS X or Windows (yet, they are working on that). Instead, you must use `docker-machine` to create and
attach to a virtual machine (VM). This machine is a Linux VM that hosts Docker for you on your Mac or Windows.
This can be easily installed using https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox[Docker Toolbox].

Follow the instructions to install Docker:

* https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v1.10.3/DockerToolbox-1.10.3.pkg[Docker Tool Box 1.10.3 for Mac]
* https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v1.10.3/DockerToolbox-1.10.3.exe[Docker Toolbox 1.10.3 for
Windows]
* http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux/[Docker on Ubuntu]
* http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/centos/[Docker on Centos]
* http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/fedora/[Docker on Fedora]

Complete set of operating systems are listed at http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Install Docker Engine].

#### Images

Do avoid waiting for docker image to download when implementing the application, you should download them beforehand:

[source]
docker pull library/java

#### Create Docker Host Mapping

If you are using Docker Machine, to make it easier to start/stop the containers, an entry is added into the host
mapping table of your operating system.

Find out the IP address of your machine:

[source]
----
docker-machine ip default
----

IMPORTANT: Replace `default` by the name of your docker machine.

This will provide the IP address associated with the Docker Machine created earlier.

Edit `/etc/hosts` (Mac OS) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows) and add:

[source, text]
----
<IP ADDRESS>  dockerhost
----

On Linux (and for the lucky people having access to the native version of docker for Windows and Mac), `dockerhost`
 is `localhost` (as it runs natively). You would need to replace every reference to `dockerhost` by `localhost`.

### Java Development Kit

You need a JDK 8 installed on your machine. Install is from:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle JDK 8]

### Maven

* Download Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
* Unzip to a directory of your choice and add it to the `PATH`.

### IDE

We recommend you to use an IDE. You can use Eclipse, IntelliJ or Netbeans.

#### No IDE ?

If you don't have an IDE, here are the step to get started with Eclipse.

1. First download Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[the download page].
2. In the _Eclipse Package_ list, select _Eclipse IDE for Java Developers_. It brings you to a download page with a
`Download` button.
3. Once downloaded, unzip it.
4. In the destination directory, you should find an `Eclipse` binary that you can execute.
5. Eclipse asks you to create a workspace.
6. Once launched, click on the _Workbench_ arrow (top right corner).
